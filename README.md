# vagrant-modern-ie
Based on the virtual machine images released with the [Modern.IE project](http://dev.modern.ie/), modern-ie-vagrant makes testing IE easier with help from [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com). The machine images in modern-ie-vagrant are based on the original images with the addition of activating WinRM to make them compatible with the [Vagrant WinRM communicator](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/winrm_settings.html).
